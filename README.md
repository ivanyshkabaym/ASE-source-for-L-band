# ASE-source-for-L-band
In this project, a code was created for the selection and calculation of a cascade for the L-band of a two-stage ASE C+L-band by simulating changes in the output signal depending on the parameters of the input signals and parameters of the doped fiber with using the project tools, that is named pyfiberamp, for calculating fiber-optic amplifiers.
